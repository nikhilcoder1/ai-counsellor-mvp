# AI Counsellor – Hackathon MVP

This project is an AI-powered study abroad counsellor built for a hackathon.

## Goal
Help students make **realistic, honest, and actionable** study abroad decisions using AI.

## Current Status
- Initial prototype built as a single-file React app
- Architecture refactor in progress (frontend + backend split)

## Architecture (Planned)
- Frontend: React (UI, onboarding, results)
- Backend: Node.js (AI orchestration, Claude integration)
- AI: Claude (via backend only)
- Demo-safe mock mode enabled

## Development Approach
This repository documents the **step-by-step evolution** of the MVP.
Commits are intentionally granular to reflect decision-making.
